    For rapid task entry, you can just type a task and hit **Enter**, then type the next one and hit **Enter** again, without ever needing to click the button.

## Managing Your Tasks

Here's how you can interact with the tasks you've created.

### Marking a Task as Complete

When you've finished a task, you can mark it as complete.

1.  **Click the checkbox** to the left of the task.
2.  The task's text will be crossed out to show it's done.

2.  The task will be removed from your list instantly.

!!! warning "Heads Up!"
    Deleting a task is permanent and cannot be undone, so be sure you want to remove it.

## Keeping Your List Tidy

A clean task list is an effective one. Here are a few tips for managing your list:

*   **Be Specific**: Write clear, actionable tasks (e.g., "Call the dentist to schedule appointment" instead of "dentist").
*   **Delete Completed Tasks**: Once a task is done and you no longer need a record of it, delete it to reduce clutter.
*   **Start Fresh**: If you ever want to reset the app to the original sample tasks, simply refresh your browser page. Note that this will erase any tasks you have added.
